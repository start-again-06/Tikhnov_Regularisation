## üìÇ Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Matrix Factorization
- Applies **SVD** to matrix `G`:  
  \[
  G = U \cdot S \cdot V^T
  \]
- Extracts singular values `S`, and determines the **rank** and **dimensions** of `G`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Regularization with Tikhonov Filtering
- Iteratively adjusts `Œ±` from `Œ±‚ÇÄ` to `Œ±_L` over 1000 steps  
- Applies filtering function:
  \[
  f(i) = \frac{s(i)^2}{s(i)^2 + \alpha(j)^2}
  \]
- Computes the filtered solution using the regularized inverse formulation

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Error & Stability Analysis
- **Residual Norm (x-axis):** Measures reconstruction error  
- **Solution Norm (y-axis):** Measures stability (magnitude) of the solution  
- Generates **log-log plots** to evaluate the tradeoff between stability and accuracy

## üìä Results & Insights

- **Higher singular values** dominate the reconstruction accuracy  
- **Regularization** smooths the solution by damping small singular value contributions  
- The **log-log curve** reveals the **optimal Œ±** where error and solution norm are balanced

## üîö Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **SVD-based Tikhonov regularization** stabilizes inverse solutions in **ill-posed problems**. By analyzing the relationship between error and solution magnitude, the optimal regularization parameter `Œ±` can be tuned for best results.
